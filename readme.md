~*~ About my Project ~*~

When at work, I ask: "How can I upgrade this process for everyone involved?"  My CoverLetter program seeks to provide a software solution to a bottleneck in my work: writing a personalized cover letter for each job application.

~*~ How to Run the Program ~*~

1. Open terminal/cmd, type clang --version, and hit enter.  If this command is recognized, clang is installed!  Else, you will need to install clang first.
2. Download the program files.
3. Using the terminal/cmd, navigate to the folder where the files are downloaded.
4. Type make coverletter, and hit enter.
5. Type ./coverletter, and hit enter.
